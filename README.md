# AI Chatbot Framework

A personal project on developing an flexible, multi-purpose chatting assistant. The original goal was to help people under depression. The main idea is to let the bot listen and discuss the issues with the person. This would help the people to speak out to "someone" and release the stress. AIYU is the name of the system. AI is not only Artificial Intelligence, but also "Love"(çˆ±) in Chinese. I hope that less people can suffer under depression. 


Major Research Areas:
